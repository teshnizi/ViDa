## What is VIDA?

VIDA is a platform for converting SQL queries into efficient c++ code. Besides conversion, it can do computations on statistically-represented data (using histograms and distributions), instead of real data.
This could be really helpful for large databases and time-consuming queries.
For instance, assume that you are going to find the sum of all values of an integer column in a table. 
In a classic scenario, you have to iterate over all values and sum them up. In VIDA, you can assume the data is uniformly or normally distributed. You can even use histograms for representing data.
We call this kind of data *virtual*, as it's not real. Now for calculating the summation of all entries, you simply have to multiply the table size in the mean of the distribution. 
Working with virtual data could be generalized to a large domain of computations: Groupings, Conditional Selections, Aggregations, ... 

VIDA is implemented based on the TPCH database but is easily generalizable to any database.

## How Does it Work?

 The approach is similar to [Neumann, 2011](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol4/p539-neumann.pdf).
 We represent each query with a tree, where each node stands for an operation. For instance, a sample tree for this query:
  
  
```sql
        select *
    from R1,R3,
   (select R2.z,count(*)
    from R2
    where R2.y=3
    group by R2.z) R2
    where R1.x=7 and R1.a=R3.b and R2.z=R3.c

```

  
could be this (Example is from the article):

For more details, you could refer to [operators header file](https://gitlab.com/teshnizi/ViDaG/blob/master/Main/operators.h). Here is a list of available nodes:

*   **Node**: Generalized Node class. All other node classes inherit from this class.
*   **ScanNode**: Used for scanning a table.
*   **HashScanNode**: Used for scanning two tables jointly, based on a common value. For instance, assume that you want to find the total cargo size needed for sending all orders. 
        For each product, you need to find entries related to it in both part table and lineitem table. Then you should calculate *peartkey\_size \* lineitem\_quantity* and sum up all such values. 
        Here you can keep a hash table so you know which entry of the lineitem table is related to which entry of the part table, without itereating over the whole table for each product.
*   **SelectNode**: Used for conditioning on values.
*   **AggregateNode**: Used for calculating functions of multiple entries (a trivial example is the summation of all quantities).
*   **JoinNode**: Used for generating a new table by joining two different tables.
*   **GroupNode**: Used for grouping values based on a specific condition.
*   **WolframAggregateNode**: Used for sending distribution-related calculations to Mathematica, receiving equivalent expressions and incorporating them into the generated code. Wolfram Alpha web API is not strong enough for calculating complex expressions,
    so we have used Mathematica instead. Mathematica is available for free on Raspberry Pi boards, and this node sends a bash command to a Raspberry Pi board via ssh:\
    `string ret = "ssh pi@192.168.43.187 \"wolframscript -format CForm -c '";`
    Therefore, in order to use distributions as data inputs, a Raspberry Pi board should be connected to your PC and ssh keys for connection should be already set up. You can take a look at [transmitter.h](https://gitlab.com/teshnizi/ViDaG/blob/master/Main/transmitter.h) for more details.

The definition of `Node` is as follows:
```cpp
class Node{
public:
    Node(string name){
        this->name = name;
    }
    Node(string name, Node* parent) : Node(name){
        this->parent = parent;
        parent->child = this;
    }
    virtual void produce(set<Attribute> *a, set<Table> tables, set<string> *fixed_tables) {
        this->child->produce(a, tables, fixed_tables);
    };

    virtual void consume(set<Attribute> *a, set<Table> tables, Node *source, set<string> *fixed_tables) {
        return;
    }

    void prep(){}

    virtual string get_class(){
        return "Node";
    }

    void set_child(Node* child){
        this->child = child;
    }
    Node* child{};
    Node* parent{};
    string name;
};
```

To generate code for a specific SQL query, first, we define database column names as a set of `Attribute`s. Then we define needed nodes and make the tree by connecting nodes to each other. 
After tree definition, we print library inclusion codes, main header, and database loading codes. Then we call `.prep()` function for each node. This function generates the prerequisite codes (things like variable definition,  hash tables creation, memory allocation, ...). Finally, we generate the main body of the code by calling `root.produce(&attributes, tables, &x);` where `tables` is a set of all tables and x is an empty set of strings.
## Examples
In this section, we discuss two TPCH queries: query 6 and query 19. You can find SQL codes [here](https://examples.citusdata.com/tpch_queries.html). Let's see how does the code work for query 6 first. The corresponding tree is:

<img src="https://gitlab.com/teshnizi/ViDaG/raw/master/Main/white.png" width = "40%">
<img src="https://gitlab.com/teshnizi/ViDaG/raw/master/Main/Q6_tree.png">

So we can define the following nodes:
```cpp
        OperandNode opd2(&l_discount_att);
        OperandNode opd3(&l_price_att);
        OperatorNode opr2(&opd3, &opd2, false, "mult", false);

        AggregateNode aggregateNode = AggregateNode("sum_price", &root, agg_sum, data_att, &opr2);
        SelectNode selectNode = SelectNode("Select", &aggregateNode, var, 1, ranges, strings, 0, valid_strings);
        ScanNode scanNode1 = ScanNode("ScanL", &selectNode);
        
        ...some preprocess codes here...
        
        

```

Then we generate prerequisite codes , call `prep()` function for each node, and call `root.produce(&attributes, tables, &x);`. You can read [the generator code](https://gitlab.com/teshnizi/ViDaG/blob/master/Main/Q6_operators.cpp) or [the generated code](https://gitlab.com/teshnizi/ViDaG/blob/master/Main/Sample%20Generated%20Codes/Q6.cpp) (comment generation is autonomous too) 
for more details. (We have assumed l_discount to be represented with a histogram in this sample)


In the other example, you can see how does VIDA use distributions. The tree for query 19 is something like this:

<img src="https://gitlab.com/teshnizi/ViDaG/raw/master/Main/white.png" width = "35%">
<img src="https://gitlab.com/teshnizi/ViDaG/raw/master/Main/Q19_tree.png">

As you can see, we are using a hash scan node rather than a scan node, as we are going to join two tables based on a common attribute. 
We compute some more complex expression instead of `sum(l_price* (1 - l_discount)` to show how useful distributions could be. Our computation target is `(l_price ^ 2 ) * ((1 + l_discount)) + psize`.
Let 
```math
psize \sim \mathcal{N}ormal(4,1)
```

```math
ldiscount \sim \mathcal{N}ormal(2,2)
```
The desired expression could be simplified to

```math
4+3 lprice^2
```

Our code executes the following command in bash:
```bash
ssh pi@192.168.43.187 "wolframscript -format CForm -c 'Expectation[(lprice ^ 2 ) * ((1 + ldiscount)) + psize, {  ldiscount\[Distributed]NormalDistribution[2,2], psize\[Distributed]NormalDistribution[4,1]}]'"
```

to send the expression to Mathematica on the raspberry board and get the result. Result is the following C code (as we used CForm option):
```cpp
4 + 3*Power(lprice,2)
```

which will be incorporated in the generated code:
```cpp
sum_price += data_data_mult_data(1 * lineitem_table_size  * part_table_size , 4 + 3*Power(lprice,2));
```

You can take a look at [the generator code](https://gitlab.com/teshnizi/ViDaG/blob/master/Main/Q19_operators.cpp) or [the generated code](https://gitlab.com/teshnizi/ViDaG/blob/master/Main/Sample%20Generated%20Codes/Q9.cpp) for more details.

## Evaluation and Testing
When working with histograms, performance and precision highly depend on number of buckets of the histograms. **The key point is that using virtual data 
has a constant overhead, regardless of the scale factor, and it eliminates the need for iterating over large tables**. We used histograms with 100 buckets. Addition and subtraction operations on such histograms
are almost 100 times slower than similar operations on real data. Multiplication and division operations are roughly 5000 times slower. Distributions, however, have almost no runtime overhead. 
After testing our code on tables of size `6e6` and setting input data to be virtual, we observed a speed up of up to `246x` for query 6 and up to `92x` for query 19.

here you can see how output results changed for several virtuality configurations:

<img src="https://gitlab.com/teshnizi/ViDaG/raw/master/Main/Documents/q19_precision.png" width ="100%">


As it could be seen in the charts, precision is more than `90%` for most of the cases, which is absolutely acceptable when we take the drastic speed ups into consideration.
